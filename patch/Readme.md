- Display registers and bits
- Bank Switching (.md2 style and a build with mbc1/3/5 style)

# Playing on console hardware, the patched ROM requires either:
- A MegaDuck Flash Cart with "MD2" banking support (16K banks switchable writing to 0x0001) such as the picoDuck by zwenergyâ€‹ (Use MD2 patch)
- Or a Game Boy Flash Cart -> to MegaDuck Cart Slot Adapter along with a Game Boy MBC5 flash cart. The adapters are not available right now, but may be in the future. (Use MBC5 patch)

# Playing on console emulators:
At this time all software emulators have slightly incorrect audio for the MegaDuck. The MiSTer MegaDuck core is the only hardware re-implementation where audio should generally sound correct.
